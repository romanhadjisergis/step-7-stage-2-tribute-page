      <h2 id="tribute-header">Here is a timeline of Alan Turing&#39;s life:</h2>
      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in London, England</li>
        <li><strong>1931</strong> - attended King&#39;s College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a first-class honours in mathematics</li>
        <li><strong>1936</strong> - published his paper &#34;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&#34;. This paper has been applauded "easily the most influential math paper in history", proving that any conceivable mathmematical computation could be executed if it was representable as an algorithm.</li> 
        <li><strong>1938</strong> - worked part-time for the British codebreaking organisation, Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS).</li>
        <li><strong>1939</strong> - The UK declared war on Germany. The following day, Turing reported to the wartime station of the GC&CS at Bletchley Park. Within a few weeks of his arrival, Turing had created the specifications for an electromechaninal machine called the bombe. It was one of the major tools used to attack the Enigma cypher machine, the machine the German military used to encode and transmit information securely.</li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - searched for a way to break into a more sophisticated German cipher machine, codenamed by the British as Tunny. He provided the first systematic method for cracking Tunny messages, known as Turingery. These broken Tunny messages contained detailed knowledge of German strategy that helped change the course of the war.</li>
        <li><strong>1946</strong> - published a paper detailing the design of the first stored-program computer. A computer that is able to run more than one hardwired program.</li>
        <li><strong>1951</strong> - became interested in morphogenesis, the process that causes organisms to develop its shape. In his publishing &#34;Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis&#34;, he suggested that a system known as a reaction-diffusion system, where chemicals react and diffuse across space, was the main phenomena of morphogenesis. His work on morphogenesis remains relevant today.</li>
        <li><strong>1954</strong> - died aged 41 at his house in Wilmslow from Cyanide poisoning.</li>
      </ul>
